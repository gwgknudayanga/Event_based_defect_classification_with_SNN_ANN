* We experimented both image-based and event-based crack and spalling defect classification with ANNs and SNNs.
* We use selected SOTA image-based datasets. To generate the event-based equivalents from those images , we simulated camera projection for a given image and generate a video and then that video is fed to v2e event camera simulator to generate events.
